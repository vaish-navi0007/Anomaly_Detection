# Anomaly Detection in Sales Data

This project demonstrates anomaly detection in sales data using Python and machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify unusual sales patterns such as sudden spikes or drops that may indicate errors, fraud, or other significant events.

## Features

- Generates synthetic sales data with seasonal patterns and injected anomalies  
- Uses Isolation Forest, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to detect anomalies  
- Visualizes sales data with highlighted anomalies  
- Easy to adapt to real-world datasets  

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.  
2. Install required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
````

2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to see anomaly detection in action:

```bash
jupyter notebook anomaly_detection.ipynb
```

or

```bash
python anomaly_detection.py
```

## How It Works

* Synthetic daily sales data is generated with seasonal variation and some artificial anomalies.
* Isolation Forest model is trained on sales data to learn normal patterns.
* The model predicts anomalies, which are visualized on the sales time series plot.

## Future Improvements

* Apply the model to real sales or finance datasets.
* Add support for multivariate anomaly detection with additional features.
* Integrate other anomaly detection algorithms like Local Outlier Factor or Autoencoders.
* Build a dashboard or alert system for real-time anomaly monitoring.
